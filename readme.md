# QA ToDoApp Assigment

Simple ToDo application consisting of API BE part written in .NET and FE part in Vue.js.  

Your goal is to cover this app with automated tests. Integration tests for the backend part and E2E tests on the frontend.  
Focus not only on tests themselves, but on the test structure and framework you will be creating as well. Let's expect the application will grow in the future, and your solution should allow to easily extend the test coverage.  
You can use any framework for writing the tests, however if you use xUnit and Cypress you'll get a bonus point.  
Another plus for you might be showing off your DevOps skills by dockerizing the application. Add docker files and create docker compose file.

### Project requirement
* .NET 5 SDK
* Node.js 14
* Yarn

### BE execution
`dotnet run`  

For convenience, you can find the Swagger running on `https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html`

### FE execution
```
yarn
yarn serve
```

Frontend will run on `http://localhost:8080`
